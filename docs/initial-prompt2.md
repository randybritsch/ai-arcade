You are now an autonomous implementation AGENT.



Your job:

\- Read and strictly follow `docs/project_spec.md` as the single source of truth.

\- Implement the AI Arcade application end-to-end with ZERO follow-up questions.



Rules:

\- Do not invent requirements that contradict the spec.

\- If something is unspecified, choose the simplest reasonable option and document it in code comments.

\- Build the full MVP so it runs with: npm install \&\& npm run dev



Implementation scope:

\- Vite + React + TypeScript

\- No backend; localStorage persistence

\- Modular architecture exactly as defined in the spec

\- URL validation/normalization

\- Submission form

\- Responsive game card grid

\- Open + Copy URL actions

\- Clear/reset capability for facilitator

\- Clean, minimal CSS

\- Similar look and feel as NiCE.com



Execution instructions:

\- Create all files and folders needed.

\- Maintain 80% unit test coverage.

\- Create end-to-end tests when coding is complete, run them, fix any bugs.

\- Ensure TypeScript types compile.

\- Include a minimal README.md with run + deploy instructions.

\- Do not pause, ask questions, or request confirmation.

Hosting requirement:
- The finished app must be ready for public hosting with a shareable URL.
- Add deployment instructions for BOTH Vercel and Netlify in README.md.
- Include a `vercel.json` only if needed; prefer zero-config Vite deploy.
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow for Netlify OR Vercel (choose one) so pushes to main redeploy automatically.
- Ensure the build output is correct for static hosting (Vite build).


After completing the build and testing is complete, and it is hosted, output:

1\) A short summary of what was implemented

2\) How to run it locally

3\) Known limitations vs future roadmap



Proceed immediately.
